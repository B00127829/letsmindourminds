      <p class="text-justify">I set up let's mind our minds three years ago and I have loved every moment of running my page. I was always passionate about mental health and it was always something that I wanted to raise awareness about, I also thought that social media especially Instagram was a very negative place for young people so I wanted to change this and use is this platform to help other people in a positive way. When I first set up my page I only had 20 followers which were my friends and family and now three years on I nearly have 2000 followers. I have been so overwhelmed with the support and the growth of my page and I never imagined this would happen. Through my page on Instagram I've met some incredible people from all around the world who are very like minded and run pages very similar to mine. I now have an amazing Instagram community that features people from all around the world and I'm so grateful to them for all of the support they give me. On my page, I post and spread awareness for mental health which is a topic that's not spoken about enough. I share helplines and organizations that people can reach out for help if they feel they are struggling with their mental health. I also spread positive messages and quotes and I also share tips on how I cope with my mental health and I hope to help others with theirs. On my page every day I post a thought of the day on my story and this is just a simple quote or message that will hopefully start people off on the right foot every day. I also do a mental health check-in every Wednesday where I check in on my followers and make sure everyone is doing okay and I also remind people to care for themselves every Sunday.

         I love what I do on my page and I really feel that I am helping people by spreading this awareness for this topic. I also in the last year have been fortunate enough to merge my two passions of design and mental health as I released quote cards that I designed for my page. The response to the quote cards has been incredible and it has been so lovely to see a piece of work that I have designed in other people's homes spreading positivity. The main message that I share on my page is that it's okay to ask for help, as I don't think enough people know that it is okay to reach out if you're struggling and to talk to someone about how you feel. I also remind people that they're not alone because even when it feels like you are alone you aren't as there's always someone to turn to whether that is a friend, family member, counselor, teacher, work colleague or even a helpline, there's always someone who is there and willing to listen to you and help you in the best way that they can. My hopes for my page to continue doing what I'm doing and helping people in the best way that I can and spreading more awareness for a topic that I'm so passionate about. I would also like to design more pieces for my page and to meet new people. I am so grateful to everyone who follows my page and you support me on the journey that I'm on right now.</p>
